# Compiling for Android

First it is required to prepare cross compile tools to compile source code in linux system for android target. Here is the steps to download and settup tools.

1- Download Android NDK:<br/>
https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads

2- We should create a standalone toolchains for compiling source code for android. Based on your platform set --arch to arm or arm64 in the following command. $corss-compile-dir is your arbitrary dir at which cross compile toolchains will be created.<br/>

$NDK/build/tools/make_standalone_toolchain.py --arch arm/arm64 --api 23 --stl gnustl --install-dir $cross_compile_dir<br/>

This command create cross compile toolchains at $cross-compile-dir.

3- Add $cross-compile-dir/bin to the path:<br/>
export PATH=$cross-compile-dir/bin/:$PATH

4- Go to the ARMCL source dir (cd $ARMCL-source-dir) and use the following command to compile it. Based on your platform set arch to armv7a or arm64-v8a in this command.<br/>
CXX=clang++ CC=clang scons Werror=0 debug=0 asserts=0 neon=1 opencl=1 os=android arch=armv7a/arm64-v8a -j8

# Compiling for linux
For cross compiling the source code in linux host for linux host you require:<br/>
gcc-linaro-6.3.1-2017.05-x86_64_arm-linux-gnueabihf for 32 bit target <br/>
gcc-linaro-6.3.1-2017.05-x86_64_aarch64-linux-gnu for 64 bit target

Then use the following command to compile. Based on your platform set arch to armv7a or arm64-v8a in this command.<br/>
scons Werror=0 -j16 debug=0 asserts=0 neon=1 opencl=1 os=linux arch=armv7a/arm64-v8a


# Running for Android
For android it is required to specify the path of libOpenCL.so. First copy this library into an arbitrary dir($lib_dir) and set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to its dir:<br/>
cp /system/lib64/egl/libGLES_mali.so $lib_dir/libOpenCL.so <br\>
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$lib_dir

Now it is ready to run built binaries in build dir of ARMCL. 
For AlexNet there is a zip file of model paramters, sample images and a label file. So you can run this graph for real data and see the results. For this purpose first download this zip file at: <br\> https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Arm%20Developer%20Community/Images/Tutorial%20Guide%20Diagrams%20and%20Screenshots/Machine%20Learning/Running%20AlexNet%20on%20Pi%20with%20Compute%20Library/compute_library_alexnet.zip?revision=c1a232fa-f328-451f-9bd6-250b83511e01&la=en&hash=7371AEC619F8192A9DE3E42FE6D9D18B5119E30C

make a directory and extract this zip file:
mkdir $assets_alexnet
unzip compute_library_alexnet.zip -d $assets_alexnet
<br/>
Run the AlexNet graph with this command. Select NEON or CL to run it on CPU or GPU respectively:
./build/examples/graph_alexnet Neon/CL $assets_alexnet $assets_alexnet/go_kart.ppm $assets_alexnet/labels.txt
